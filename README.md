# Introduction to Front-end Development with ReactJS

By the end of this project, you will create and deploy a Web App using ReactJS that displays data in a table, which can be updated or deleted by the user. We will go through multiple ways to initialize a React app, then build on it using functional components and React Hooks to work with modern React development methodologies. Moreover, we will look at a basic overview of React Router. In the end, we'll finally deploy our newly created web app to Netlify to make it available to the public.

**Learning Objectives**
- React Basics and Theory
- Initializing a ReactJS project
- React Router for single-page navigation
- Components, Hooks, and State
- Deploying your project to the internet
- What's next to do/learn after this course

**Meet the Instructor**

Hi! I'm Kumail, and I'll be your instructor for this course. I have been working exclusively as a front-end developer on ReactJS for most of the past three years, and have had the opportunity to work with clients around the globe on all kinds of applications, as well as launch my own software services agency. This learning experience has led me to get a firm grasp on ReactJS and its features, and I frequently write articles on various platforms to share my knowledge, and I'll be happy to get you started with ReactJS through this course.

**About Rhyme**

This course runs on Coursera's hands-on platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops that have all the software and data you will need. So, you can just focus on learning. For this project, this means instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and TensorFlow pre-installed.  


If you need help troubleshooting Rhyme, please refer to the Coursera Help Center for more information.


**Earn a Certificate**

After you have completed the Introduction to Front-end Development with ReactJS - The Core Concepts hands-on project, you will be able to assess your knowledge using an ungraded assignment. Once you are comfortable with the concepts, take the final quiz, and score higher than 80% to earn your certificate.

# Introduction to Front-end Development with ReactJS - The Core Concepts
